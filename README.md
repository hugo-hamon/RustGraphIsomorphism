# RustGraphIsomorphism

This project was developed as part of a Master's level internship with the primary goal of learning and implementing the k-Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) graph isomorphism test.

## Purpose

The main objective is to generate all non-isomorphic graphs of a given size that share the same 1-WL hash. The k-WL algorithm is a powerful tool for distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. This project explores its application and the characteristics of graphs that the 1-WL test fails to differentiate. The implementation was done in Rust.
